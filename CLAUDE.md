# CLAUDE.md

Wild Animal band site — Jekyll on GitHub Pages, served at
[wildanimalmusic.com](https://wildanimalmusic.com). Two-person operation:
John (technical, runs Claude Code) and Marie (writes copy via Claude chat;
not a coder). `README.md` is the human-facing setup doc; this file is the
LLM-facing operating contract.

## How requests arrive

This repo runs the **Project-as-control-plane / Claude-Code-as-executor**
pattern. Spec drafts originate in the Anthropic Project (project knowledge,
chat with John); Claude Code executes them here. If anything in this file
conflicts with a spec the operator pastes in, ask before editing.

Marie may eventually reach the repo via plain-English GitHub Issues (e.g.
the `@claude` Action) or a CMS at `/admin`. Either way the asks land
against the verb-to-file map below — that map is the contract.

## Repo map

```
_layouts/default.html      Page scaffolding (head, header, footer, script)
_includes/                 head, header, footer, script — iterate _data/nav.yml
_data/nav.yml              Primary nav (label, href, key) — single source of truth
*.html                     One file per page: front matter + <main> body
lyrics/, musings/          Per-album lyric pages and per-essay pages
styles/main.css            Design system; :root token block at top, then page styles
assets/images/             Generated responsive variants — do not hand-edit
_originals/                Source images, committed; never linked from HTML
scripts/build-images.js    Generates assets/images/ from _originals/ (idempotent)
README.md                  Human-facing setup and conventions
Research/                  Background research; excluded from Jekyll build
```

## Build and preview

- `bundle exec jekyll serve` — local preview at http://localhost:4000
- `bundle exec jekyll build --safe` — full build; catches Liquid syntax errors
- `node scripts/build-images.js` — regenerate `assets/images/` from `_originals/`
- Push to `main` → GitHub Pages auto-deploys, live within ~1 minute.
  No GitHub Actions, no CI, no plugins beyond the GH Pages allowlist.

## Editor verb → file map

This is the prompt-surface contract. When a request comes in, it lands in
one of these files. If a request doesn't fit, ask which entry to extend.

| Request | File(s) |
|---|---|
| Add or rename a primary nav item | `_data/nav.yml` (header + footer iterate it) |
| Edit the homepage news block or hero | `index.html` |
| Edit about-page bio | `about.html` |
| Edit contact text or photo credit | `contact.html` |
| Add or edit lyrics | `lyrics/<album>.html` |
| Add a musing | new `musings/<slug>.html`; link from `musings.html` |
| Add a release page | new `<slug>.html` at root; link from `music.html` |
| Change site title or description | `_config.yml` |
| Change a color, font size, spacing, layout token | `styles/main.css` `:root` block |
| Add or replace an image | drop file in `_originals/`, run `node scripts/build-images.js`, update `assets/images/MANIFEST.md`, reference variants from HTML |

## Front matter

Every page starts with this block. `nav_active` must equal a `key` in
`_data/nav.yml` for active-link styling to apply.

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: My Page          # optional; omit on home
description: ...        # optional; falls back to site description
nav_active: about       # optional; must match a _data/nav.yml key
---
```

## Conventions

- Every URL in shared HTML goes through `{{ '/path' | relative_url }}`. No hard-coded leading slashes.
- All colors, type sizes, spacing come from CSS custom properties in `styles/main.css` `:root`. No hex values outside that block.
- Every `<img>` has explicit integer `width` and `height` (prevents CLS).
- Every image is delivered via `<picture>` with a WebP `<source>` and a JPG or PNG fallback `<img>`, at multiple widths.
- Self-host fonts. Never link the Google Fonts CDN (GDPR; the 2022 Munich ruling makes this concrete for a Berlin-based site).

## JS posture

JS today is the mobile-menu toggle in `_includes/script.html` and the
animation web components in `_includes/animation.html`. CSS-only is
the default for layout, transitions, and sticky-scroll effects
(alternating columns, hover states). JS lands when CSS can't carry the
weight — page-load animations, audio playback, scroll-driven sequencing.
New JS arrives as HTML web components that upgrade working static markup
on `connectedCallback`. The default animation primitive is Motion
(motion.dev); GSAP + ScrollTrigger is reserved for true scroll-sequenced
work. Audio uses Howler. CDN imports via `<script type="module">`; no
build step. No SPA frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte), no Tailwind, no
Jekyll plugins.

## Visual work — don't fly blind

For any change that affects layout, styling, or imagery: build the site,
render the changed page, and look at the rendered result before declaring
the change done. Markup that parses is not the same as a layout that
works, and a CSS rule that compiles is not the same as a sticky element
that actually sticks. If you can't render the site (Jekyll fails, no
headless browser available, image viewer blocked), stop and report which
step is blocked rather than shipping markup-only changes.

When verifying visual changes, screenshot for layout but extract the
actual DOM text (`page.evaluate(() => document.body.innerText)` or
similar) to verify content. Visually paraphrasing a screenshot can
fabricate text — Claude has previously transcribed "It's Chaos, Drop
me Off" as "It's Chaos Drop No One." Two checks: layout from PNG,
content from DOM.

## Git and PRs

- One commit per logical content change. Subject line: what changed and why, not how.
- Commit at each stable point during multi-step work so any step can be reverted.
- Open a PR for non-trivial changes; John reviews and merges.
- If a fix attempt fails twice, stop and propose three approaches before trying again.

## Do not edit

- `_site/` — Jekyll build output.
- `.jekyll-cache/` — local cache.
- Files in `assets/images/` directly — they regenerate from `_originals/`.
- `Research/` — reference material, excluded from build.

## Pointers (load on demand)

- Image-pipeline rationale and edge cases: read header comments in `scripts/build-images.js`.
- Architectural background: `Research/prompt_driven_web_dev_research.md`.
